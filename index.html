<!-- HTML / CSS Assessment
Follow the instructions and place your code in the appropriate section below.
If you have any clarifying questions, feel free to ask. Good luck!

1. Pull Bootstrap CSS from a CDN
2. Add a bootstrap navbar. Include a header on the left that points to index.html and three links that point to example1.html, example2.html and example3.html. Those pages do not need to exist.
3. Override the navbar's background color to any color you'd like. Override the links' hover color to any color you'd like.
4. Add a section underneath the navbar. Give the section top and bottom padding of 30px. Give the section an h1 tag with any title you'd like.
5. Add two divs to the section that are each 50% of the width of the section when the screen is over 768px, and 100% the width of the section when the screen is less than 768px. Use only bootstrap classes for this.
6. Using the Bootstrap documentation, find out how to use the bootstrap classes "container" and "row" to format the two divs as well.
7. In each div, first include a public domain image that is formatted using bootstrap classes to have a responsive size. Underneath each image, include a p tag with a description of the image. Use other html tags to format the keywords in your description to be italic. -->
